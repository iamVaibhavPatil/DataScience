# Introduction
Data Science and Machine learning using Python. We will explore different tools -

1) Numpy  
2) Pandas  
3) Matplotlib  
4) Seaborn  
5) Plotly and Cufflinks
6) Machine Learning Models  
    - Linear Regression  
    - Cross Validation and Bias-Variance Trade Off
    - Logistic Regression  
    - K Nearest Neighbors  
    - Decision Trees and Random Forest  
    - Support Vector Machines  
    - K Means Clustering  
    - Principal Component Anlysis
    - NLP  
    - Recommender System  
    - PySpark  
    - Neural Nets and Deep Learning  

# Envrionment Setup  
Anaconda Download and Install.

# Python for Data Analysis - NumPy
Numpy is a Linear Algebra library for Python. It is so important for Data Science with Python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on Numpy as one of their main building blocks.

NumPy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries.

If we have Anaconda distribution, we can install NumPy by executing below command-

```
# Recommended if Anaconda is installed.
conda install numpy

# Using Python, if no Anaconda distribution
pip install numpy
```

NumPy arrays come in two flavors: `Vectors` and `Matrices`.  

Vectors are strictly 1-d arrays and matrices are 2-d(matrix can have only one row or column)
