# Python for Data Analysis - NumPy
Numpy is a `Linear Algebra` library for Python. It is so important for Data Science with Python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on Numpy as one of their main building blocks.

NumPy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries.

If we have Anaconda distribution, we can install NumPy by executing below command-

```
# Recommended if Anaconda is installed.
conda install numpy

# Using Python, if no Anaconda distribution
pip install numpy
```

## NumPy Arrays  
NumPy arrays come in two flavors: `Vectors` and `Matrices`.  

Vectors are strictly 1-d arrays and matrices are 2-d(matrix can have only one row or column).

We can convert existing list or list of list into 1-d or 2-d array respectively.

```
my_list = [1,2,3]

import numpy as np

# 1-d array
arr = np.array(my_list)
arr
>>> array([1, 2, 3])

# 2-d Array
my_mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
np.array(my_mat)
>>>
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 9]])
```

Most common way to create numpy array is using `arange(start, stop, step)`. It is similar to `range()` function in python.

```
np.arange(0,11)
>>> array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10])

np.arange(0,11,2)
>>> array([ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10])
```

We can also create specific array like arrays with all zero values by specifying number of rows or columns.

`zeros(number of elements)` for 1-d arrays  
`zeros((rows, columns))` for 2-d arrays

```
np.zeros(3)
>>> array([0., 0., 0.])

np.zeros((3,3))
>>> array([[0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0.]])
```

Similarly `ones` for arrays with all 1.

```
np.ones(4)
>>> array([1., 1., 1., 1.])

np.ones((2,3))
>>> array([[1., 1., 1.],
       [1., 1., 1.]])
```

`linspace(start, stop, num)` - This will return `evenly spaced` num of points within start to stop range.

```
np.linspace(0,5,10)
>>>
array([0.        , 0.55555556, 1.11111111, 1.66666667, 2.22222222,
       2.77777778, 3.33333333, 3.88888889, 4.44444444, 5.        ])
```

We can also create `identity matrix`. Identity matrix is used in linear algebra. Number of rows and columns are equal. All diagonal elements are 1 and others are 0.

```
np.eye(4)
>>>
array([[1., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 1., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 1.]])
```
